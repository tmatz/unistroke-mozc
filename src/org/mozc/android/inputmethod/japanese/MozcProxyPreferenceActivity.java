/**
 * A proxy activity invoked from launcher.

 * Preference activity (MozcClassicPreferenceActivity and MozcFragmentPrefernceActivity)
 * is invoked from 1. Launcher, 2. Language preference, 3. Keyboard long tap.
 * On 2 and 3 we specify which activity to launch by string resource.
 * But launcher sees AndroidManfest.xml to find the activity to launch,
 * but &lt;activity&gt; tag does not accept string resource (accepts only fixed string).
 * Thus we use this activity in manifest file as a launch activity and
 * this activity redirects incoming access to real activity.
