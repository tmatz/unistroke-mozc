<!-- An empty ScrollView to wrap content view of dialogs.

  <!-- Note: there is a bug on ScrollView to put the content in the center of the pane.
       What we want to do here is:
       - Show the content with "wrap_content" size at the (vertically) center of ScrollView
         if it's large enough.
       - Otherwise, show the simple ScrollView as usual.
       This is the work around of the bug.
